summary: Personal Data Security in a post-Roe Digital Landscape
---

We all have one, but how much does it know about you? Your smartphone, along with technology companies, collect lots of information to advertise, personalize, and enhance your experience on the web. I want my services to give me recommendations based on what I like, and recommendations that are relevant in my area. In most cases this is fine if you accept the tradeoff between privacy and function. However, this information may be weaponized in a post-Roe world, as a right to digital privacy still is not guaranteed.

There could be much discourse on the substance of pro-life vs. anti-abortion debate, but I believe this is a deeper issue. Without a guaranteed right to privacy in the United States, the national and state level governments can access personal information collected by major tech companies. This constant threat will continue to pervade the lives of average Americans until broader privacy protections are codified into law. A supreme court decision is not enough to ensure this right, in my opinion.

The next few passages will contain some examples and background information on suits and cases that have utilized personal data to prosecute abortion seekers. Additionally, there are a couple more functions that could be weaponized if state law enforcement were to pursue said avenues.

### Location Data

You take your smartphone with you everywhere. If you are like me, you feel naked without it. But what if it told authorities where you were? Vice writer Joseph Cox recently wrote a blog article detailing the sale and potential de-anonymization of location data in relation to planned parenthood service locations.

This data is collected from various apps on your smartphone, and said data is re-sold through a company called SafeGraph. SafeGraph pays app developers to send them location data via their apps. While the data is anonymized, it is trivial to figure out the identity of someone through location data.

Where is your phone most of the day? Where is it most of the night? You can find a work address and a home address with these two questions. See what I mean?

Please give Joseph’s blog a read, it’s a great overview on how these things work.

### Search History
A 2017 case in Mississippi shows how your internet search history can create a paper trail. This information is used as evidence by prosecutors to build cases. The defendant searched for abortion drugs, and this search history was subpoenaed and used as evidence in a trial for the death of a fetus.

While a grand jury chose not to indict, we do not need to be giving a prosecution anything they can build a case with. 

### Messaging 

Private messages can be used to help convict, as well. In 2015, a woman was convicted to a 20-year prison sentence for feticide. Part of the evidence included text messages from her phone, which included her talking to a friend about buying abortion drugs online. In positive news, her sentence was overturned in 2016.

### Fertility and Reproductive Health Apps

Names like Flo, Ovia, Clue, and Glow come to mind. These applications take in a lot of information, much of which is incredibly personal. How do these apps protect that data? What else might they do with it?

One example is the company Ovia Health giving health data to employers. The information is “anonymized”. As stated previously, it is possible to de-anonymize this data. While this instance may not be of concern in the overarching issue, it shows the capacity for these applications to collect and give this information out.

Next up is Flo. Flo settled a lawsuit with the FTC over inappropriate sharing of user data. Flo promised that all of the information would remain private, but still shared 100 million users’ data with a third-party data analytics firm.

I highlight these stories to show the potential future we live in, where this data could be garnered to support criminal cases. It would be a wise move to get rid of these applications on your phone if you are concerned. Additionally, these types of applications are not considered “covered entities” under HIPAA regulations, thus they do not have to comply with HIPAA guidance. 

# What Can I Do?

Now, to the matter of protecting yourself from these things. I’m going to draw from a EFF article published by Daly Barnett on this topic specifically. The EFF, or Electronic Frontier Foundation, is an organization committed to defending civil liberties in a digital world.

<strong>I will talk about the technology recommendations here, but the article goes more in depth on strategy. Give it a read!</strong>

### Compartmentalize your Identity
You should separate your online identities. If you are in a state where abortion is illegal, be sure to anonymize your digital self as much as possible.

### Use a privacy focused browser
DuckDuckGo, Brave, Firefox are better at keeping your private data from leaking.

* <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>
* <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>

### Limit browsers from collecting too much information
Install privacy focused extensions, like PrivacyBadger, uBlock Origin, etc.
Also, choose browsers that are private by design. See the list above. These browsers combined with extensions are powerful.

### Use a secondary email
Don’t sign up for appointments using your email address you use for everything. Especially if it has your name on it. Here are a couple of services that add privacy protection.

### Encrypted Messaging

There are apps that are end-to-end encrypted when sending messages. Apps like iMessage on iPhones, Signal, and Telegram.

* <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a>

### Use a VPN
When doing searches and internet browsing, use a VPN to hide what you’re doing online from your internet service providers. Be careful, though, as some VPNs can be malicious, or over promise the protection they provide.

### Turn off your phone
If you are travelling somewhere sensitive, turn off your phone. Better yet if you can leave it somewhere do that too. I’m sure it’s not quite like “no face, no case” but it helps. 

## Final Thoughts

I have presented a lot of information quickly in the hopes that it can reach hands that need it and be effective. All the examples presented at the beginning of this writing could be used to build cases if reproductive laws are left up to states for interpretation. Further privacy law must be codified to protect us from the overstep of our governments into our digital identities, and this is yet another overreach.
