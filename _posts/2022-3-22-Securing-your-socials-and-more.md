<div class="message">
  With all the talk of cyber attacks the past couple days, people are nervous. Especially since there isn't much guidance for individuals. In this series I'm going to give you some steps on how you can secure your digital life, right now. <strong>Additionally, you are unlikely to be targeted as an individual.</strong> The warnings are more for business and private sector organziations. I always take the opportunity to educate if cyber security news gets to the general population.

Below are the official communications from the White House and the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)

When you think of MFA what comes to mind? Your bank, texting you a code so you can login? Apple sending you a code when you sign in from an unknown location? What does the MFA acronym even stand for? Let's jump in!

## What is MFA?
MFA, or Multi Factor Authentication, is a form of verifying your identity when logging in to digital services. Basically, it is using another item (token code, text message number, phone call, etc) in conjunction with your password to get logged in.

Visit the link below to read more about MFA for a deeper dive:

## Why use MFA?
The question I get the most is why. MFA gets in the way of getting into my stuff and I can get locked out. Why use it?

Have you been seeing those scams on Instagram where your friends profile gets taken over? How about on Twitter, where your follower becomes a bot, shilling fake Raybans and crypto coins? If you aren't using MFA, this can happen to you.

## I already use MFA, why should I bother doing what you're telling me?

Up to this point, you've probably been thinking about which accounts you'll need this on. Something else to consider is moving away from using text message, phone call based, or email based MFA. Why? Because an attack called SIM Swapping is on the rise.

This allows an attacker to briefly take over your phone number and receive all the password reset and login codes sent to your phone. Worse than that, they could get into your email. That, in most cases, contains the keys to your online identity.

## How to use MFA

So what's the solution? We need to use MFA that is based on our phone or on a physical item we have. Google and Microsoft both make authenticator apps that can store MFA tokens that you use every day. These are time based and change every 30 seconds. The best part? An attacker would need access to your phone directly in order to steal these codes. Below are links to the app stores for both Microsoft and Google Authenticator Apps. For the sake of this post, I'll be showing how to set it up using Google Authenticator. Once you know how the process works, you can do it with any authenticator application.

* <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605">Google Authenticator - Apple App Store</a>
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_US&gl=US">Google Authenticator - Google Play Store (Android)</a>
* <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458">Microsoft Authenticator - Apple App Store</a>
* <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en_US&gl=US">Microsoft Authenticator - Google Play Store (Android)</a>

So go ahead and download the app for your phone and let's get started.

We're going to go through Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook in this blog post. I applaud you if you don't have all three, but if you're a junkie like me you do.

<strong>The goal of doing three of them in one sitting is getting you used the process, rather than just doing it once and forgetting about it. Once you have the knowledge on how to turn on MFA, it is generally the same on any other website or service. You digital life is online, let's protect it.</strong>

### Instagram
For Instagram, start by going to your profile page 

1. tap the 3 vertical bars in the upper right hand corner.

    ![Instagram Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Insta-MFA-1.png)

2. Next, tap settings

    ![Instagram Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Insta-MFA-1.png)

3. Then, tap Security

    ![Instagram Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Insta-MFA-2.png)

4. Tap Two-factor authentication

    ![Instagram Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Insta-MFA-3.png)


5. At this point, we're going to choose Authentication app (recommended) for the reasons mentioned earlier in the article

    ![Instagram Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Insta-MFA-4.png)


6. Click "Set up another way" underneath

    ![Instagram Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Insta-MFA-5.png)


7. Here is where we will copy the set up key to put into the Authenticator App. Click Copy Key.

    ![Instagram Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Insta-MFA-6.png)


8. Now we'll open the Authenticator App we downloaded earlier. I'm using Google Authenticator for this tutorial. Tap the + sign in the bottom right corner.

    ![Instagram Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Insta-MFA-7.png)


9. Tap "Enter a setup key"

    ![Instagram Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Insta-MFA-8.png)


10. Enter a name for the account like "Instagram" and then paste the key you copied in step 7 into the key field. Then Click "Add"

    ![Instagram Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Insta-MFA-9.png)


11. Check it out, we've got a code for Instagram! Now we need to tap that code to copy it.

    ![Instagram Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Insta-MFA-10.png)


12. Switch back to the Instagram App. It will ask you to paste the code from your Authenticator app. Once you do that you're done.

    ![Instagram Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Insta-MFA-11.png)


13. It will generate some backup codes. Store these in a safe place in case you lose your phone!

    ![Instagram Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Insta-MFA-12.png)


And that's all for Instagram. Moving on to Twitter.



### Twitter
I'm doing this portion on a computer to give a different perspective on how MFA can be set up.

1. Click on More, then settings

2. Click Security and account access, then Security

    ![Twitter Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Twitter-MFA-1.png)

3. From there, click Authentication app

    ![Twitter Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Twitter-MFA-2.png)

4. A QR code you can scan should appear

    ![Twitter Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Twitter-MFA-3.png)

5. Open your Authenticator app on your phone, click the + sign, and click "Scan a QR code"

    ![Twitter Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Twitter-MFA-4.PNG)

6. The site will now appear in the Authenticator app

    ![Twitter Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Twitter-MFA-5.PNG)

7. Enter the code from the Authenticator app into the browser where you scanned the QR code

    ![Twitter Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Twitter-MFA-6.png)

8. You're all set! Next time you log into Twitter, you'll need to use the Authenticator app.

    ![Twitter Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Twitter-MFA-7.png)

### Facebook

1. From the Facebook mobile application, select Menu in the bottom right corner

    ![Facebook Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Facebook-MFA-1.PNG)

2. Click "Password and Security"

    ![Facebook Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Facebook-MFA-2.PNG)


3. Tap "Use two-factor authentication"

    ![Facebook Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Facebook-MFA-3.PNG)


4. Choose the Authentication app method

    ![Facebook Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Facebook-MFA-4.PNG)


5. For this, you need to tap the code to copy it. It is below the QR code, and a tap will copy it.

    ![Facebook Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Facebook-MFA-5.PNG)


6. Go to your Authenticator app. Click the + sign, then choose "Enter a setup key". Now you're getting the hang of this!

    ![Facebook Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Facebook-MFA-6.PNG)


7. Input a name for the token and paste the code you copied in step 5 into the key field

    ![Facebook Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Facebook-MFA-7.PNG)


8. You now have a token for your Facebook account!

    ![Facebook Settings](\assets\2022-3-22\Facebook-MFA-8.PNG)


9. Copy the code and switch back over to your Facebook app to verify. Copy the backup codes to a safe place in case your phone is lost.

## Conclusion

Just like that, you've added another layer of protection to your social media accounts! Like I mentioned earlier, protecting yourself in a connected world takes a bit of learning but it is worth the time for the skills that you gain. You should now be able to turn on MFA for your banking sites, email, and even your crypto accounts. It is always less work to turn on extra protection than it is to clean up once your accounts have been compromised.

I hope you learned something and please share!
